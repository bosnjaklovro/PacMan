The single player mode allows you to play alone. The multiplayer mode allows you to play with other people, for this mode it is important that one person starts the server and the others connect through the client. The launching server allows you to join a server and play the game this way.


Instructions on how to play
The main goal of this game is to collect as many donuts as possible. They are collected by eating each donut. In the game you will notice ghosts that cause danger for pacman and his goal is to stay far away as possible from them. If the ghost manages to get to you, you will die and the game will be over. 


The controls for controlling the pacman are: up, down, left and right keys. You can also use: W, A, S, D keys.         Using these keys you will be able to control pacman on any white area, however you will not be able to go over walls which are the blue blocks. 


When playing in multiplayer mode, the main goal is to collect more donuts than your component.
